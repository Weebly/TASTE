Pronounced "TASTY", TASTE (The Automated Selenium Testing Environment), is a framework built using Selenium Grid and VirtualBox, that enables fully
automated testing, with fresh virtual machines for each session.

## Features

#### Real time dashboard

View real time statuses of active sessions. Information such as current status, test result, VM host, rdp port, etc are all available on a real time dashboard.

#### HTML5 compatible screencasts 

Review test runs in browser using HTML5 (webm) compatibile screencasts, built into the real time dashboard.

#### Logstash support, built in

Just about every event that takes place, can be sent to logstash automatically. You just need to enable it, in the configs.
