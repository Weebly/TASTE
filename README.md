Pronounced "TASTY", TASTE (The Automated Selenium Testing Environment), is a framework buit on top of Selenium Grid that enables fully
automated testing, with fresh virtual machines for each session (similar current commercial services available today). With TASTE,
you can have the same quality service, hosted internally on your own hardware. The only limits of scaling, are the number of servers
you can allocate to be used with the TASTE system.

## Features

### Real time dashboard

View real time statuses of active sessions. Information such as current status, test result, VM host, rdp port, etc are all available on a real time dashboard.

### HTML5 compatible screencasts 

Review test runs in browser using HTML5 (webm) compatibile screencasts, built into the real time dashboard.

### Logstash support, built in

Just about every event that takes place, can be sent to logstash automatically. You just need to enable it, in the configs.
